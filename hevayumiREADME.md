Instructor : Dr. Rachel Schwartz

Introduction
This assignment aims to write scripts that can run using the command line based on DNA' data of species. It created several function to define a sequence object, count kmers of any size k, create linguistic complexity create table of observe and possible kmers, make graph from data of observed kmers, and use the main function to read data and output.

Steps
1 Import required library packages: glob, pandas, matplotlib, numpy and sys
2 Create function to count kmers
3 Create script the wrong DNA kmers except ACGT
4 Create table of each sequence name consisting of Kmers, Observed and Possible Kmers
5 Make graph of linguistic complexity and graph comparison between observed and possible Kmers in each sequence name

Output
1 Table in csv
2 Graph in png

Exception
Although an expression is syntactically correct, it may cause error while executed.
